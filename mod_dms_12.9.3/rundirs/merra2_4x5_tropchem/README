This is the GEOS-Chem run directory for the 4x5 tropospheric chemistry 
simulation. This directory can be used with GEOS-FP or MERRA-2 meteorology.

The various input files (e.g. HEMCO_Config.template, HISTORY.rc, etc.) are
stored in ../shared_inputs/tropchem.  This allows us to keep a single set of 
these files in one location, for convenience.  A new HEMCO_Config.rc file will 
be created from the HEMCO_Config.template file each time the unit tester is 
run.

A new input.geos file will also be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
